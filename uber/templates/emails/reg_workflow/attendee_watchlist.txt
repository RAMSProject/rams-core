Someone named {{ attendee.full_name }} has just registered for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and that name is on our watchlist.  This may or may not be the same person, but we should definitely look into it.

You can see their registration at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/registration/form?id={{ attendee.id }}. From there, you can click the WatchList tab to see the watchlist entry that matches them. If you don't see the tab, please contact an admin.
