    <h2> You may be banned from {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}! </h2>

    <p>
      Our list of banned people includes someone named <b>{{ attendee.full_name }}</b>.  Every banned attendee has
      been told they are banned, so if this is not a mistake then you should definitely know it.  However, if you
      just happen to have the same name as someone who has been banned, then go ahead and continue.  If we see someone
      on our banned list complete their registration then we'll contact you to validate that you're someone else.
