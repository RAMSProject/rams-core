<h3 align="center"> Required Roles </h3>

Some jobs require more trust than others. For example, we don't want just
anyone working at the merch booth, since they handle a lot of our money.

You may mark a job as requiring a set of roles to ensure that only staffers
that have been granted those roles can sign up for it. You may grant a
staffer roles on the department admin page.
